# Project teamwork contract

*Course: MSCI 522 - Data Science Workflows*

### Team Members

- Daniel Cairns
- Crystal Geng
- Renzo Winjgaarden
- Mohammad Reza Nabizadeh

## Expectation and Ground Rules

All group members will contribute their best efforts to ensure the project's success. We will endeavor to distribute the work evenly, while taking into consideration each member's preferences and skillset. All members collectively hold responsibility to ensure our deliverables are correct and complete, even if they did not personally work on them. 

## Weekly Schedule & Deadlines

**Thursday 2 PM - 6 PM** - Group meets to discuss the next milestone and divide the deliverables.  

**Saturday 12 PM** - Deadline for weekly deliverables.

**Saturday 12 - 6 PM** - Team members will check in remotely to merge our code, resolve any issues, and check over the final submission.

- Members should expect to spend upwards of an hour each Saturday afternoon finalizing our submission.

## Communication and Conflict Management

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

    1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.

    2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.

    3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
