## Proposed Data Analysis

In order to answer the inferential question above, we are going to conduct various statistical analyses including a two-sample t-test, pearson correlation coefficient analysis and linear regression. To carry out the t-test, we will first carry out a hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis is that the mean rank is the same for the first ten countries that perform and the last ten countries that perform, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean rank of the last ten countries that perform is higher (the rank index is smaller) than the first ten countries that perform.

Since the dataset contains the data for each country from 1956 to 2022, we are able to select the countries with the least ten running orders and the countries with the most ten running orders and calculate their respective mean ranks across all the years. The purpose of selecting only the top and last ten countries to perform every year, instead of dividing all the countries into two groups is to avoid ambiguity in classification. For instance, if there are 60 countries in total and they are divided into two separate groups called "countries that perform first" and "countries that perform last", the 30th country will be classified as "countries that perform first" and the 31st country will be classified as "countries that perform last", but in fact their running orders are next to each other in the middle and it would not be a sensible choice to classify them differently.

We will also apply a pearson correlation coefficient analysis as well as a simple linear regression model to measure the linear correlation between the running order and the rank. For these analyses, we will not need to separate the countries into two groups according to their running orders since we will treat their running orders as continuous variables.
