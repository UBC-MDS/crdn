# Contributing to the Eurovision project

This outlines how to propose and contribute changes to our project. 
Generally, as this is a short-term project for an academic course, 
outside contributions are not encouraged at this time.

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in **documentation** may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.
Larger changes must be subject to approval.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, please first file an issue to
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and demonstrate the bug if possible.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New code should adhere to standard style guides: 
	- tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org)
	- PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
